This is a tiny script that "still" uses qt to sit in your tray and change wallpapers, just for you.
Main idea is to grub some fresh and good wallpapers based on your preferences, tags, likes, etc

This script is kind of pre alpha, and if you still wanna use it than

## TODO
making client side more accurate
Add cinnamon, mate, gnome support
Add windows support

rewrite it to GTK3+(maybe)
